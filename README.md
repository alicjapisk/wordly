I'm currently working on a cross-platform application called Wordly, available on iOS, Android, and the Web. Wordly is designed to help users create, organize, and study their own custom flashcards. The goal is to provide a flexible and intuitive tool for personal learning and vocabulary building.

I'm building the app using React Native to ensure a consistent experience across all platforms, and I'm using Supabase as the backend for authentication, database storage, and real-time syncing.

To ensure the app is reliable and user-friendly, I'm also setting up automated testing: Appium for mobile platforms and Selenium for the web version. This helps catch bugs early and maintain quality as the app grows.
